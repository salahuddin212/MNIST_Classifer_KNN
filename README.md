# ðŸ§  MNIST Digit Classifier (K-Nearest Neighbors + Grid Search)

This project is an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for handwritten digit classification using the MNIST dataset.

It demonstrates a complete ML workflow including:
- Problem framing and dataset loading
- Visualization of sample digits
- Train-test splitting with stratification
- Model training with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search with cross-validation
- Final model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score

### ðŸš€ Technologies Used:
- Python 3.x
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

### ðŸ“ˆ Dataset:
MNIST Handwritten Digits (from `fetch_openml`)

### ðŸ“Š Performance Metrics:
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score
